- MAC installation issues. 
    - globally managed packages vs locally managed packages for conda.
    - brew based installation of dill
- Linux
    - No issues.
    - sudo access, didn't try the local installation
- Windows
    - I don't have windows. 
    - Judging from the MAC experience, installation may have some issues with paths and dill. 
    - Will try later.
